#Namespace is like a container or a simple system that helps to control the name conflicts whilst
#in a program. Namespace helps to map the variable, or function name, to its object accordingly.
#There are three namespaces particularly in Python
#1) Local Namespace: This namespace holds and avoids conflicts of all the names used within a function. 
# As soon as the function is returned, this namespace is deleted.
#2) Global Namespace: This namespace holds and avoids conflicts of all the names used with all the
#imported Python modules and is created for every module included in the Python Project. 
#It is created when the Python Project runs
#3) Build In Namespace: This namespace holds and avoids conflicts of all the names of built-in Python.
#It is created when the Python Interpreter runs.
